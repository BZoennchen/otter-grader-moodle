# ograder

A package to ease the construction management and grading of [otter](https://otter-grader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)-notebooks.
Grading is implemented such that it works with the [moodle](https://moodle.de/) learning platform.

## Features

+ intialize your ``ograder`` project by using a simple ``.yml`` config file
+ automatically generate:
  1. student notebooks
  2. solution notebooks
  3. autograder zip file
+ add the template of additional questions to any main notebook
+ upgrade your ``ograder`` project, i.e., sync your files with the ``.yml`` config file
+ add the template, i.e. all the meta cells, for additional questions
+ add questions generated by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) (requires an **API key**)
+ **TODO**: extract questions from multiple notebooks and copy them into a another notebook
